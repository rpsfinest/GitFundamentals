# Git clone
Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a close, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

Its will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you use `git pull` updates from the orginal repository.

Its canbe done with the `git close` command as see here :
```
git clone https://github.com/elevenfiftyacademy/terminaldungeon.git
```
