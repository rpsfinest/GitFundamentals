#Git Add
When changes have been made inside git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command. Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified. Generally, you can get away with the command `get add .` which will add All files directories that were added, changed, or deleted. You can try changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2`  which will track specifically file 1 and file 2. You can specify tracking the directories with `git add DirectoryName`.
